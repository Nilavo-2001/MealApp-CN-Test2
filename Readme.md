Features:

1.Home Page

Can Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results updates, just like Google does for suggestions).
Each search result of the meal has a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list).
On clicking any particular search result (any meal), opens a new page with more information about that meal(meal page)

2.Meal Detail Page

shows information about the meal like its name, photo, instructions, etc.

3.My favourite meals Page

Displays a list of all the favourite meals.
This list is persistent (should have the same number of meals before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).
Remove from favourites button: Each meal has remove button, clicking on which removes that meal from the list.
